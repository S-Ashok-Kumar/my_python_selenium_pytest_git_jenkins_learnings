"""
Class variables:
1. Defined inside a class, but outside any method.
2. Shared by all objects (instances) of the class.
3. If one object changes a class variable (and itâ€™s not shadowed by an instance variable),
   that change is visible to all other objects.
4. Accessible at class level and instance level (through ClassName.var or self.var).

Instance variables:
1. Defined inside methods (usually __init__) using self.
2. Each object (instance) has its own separate copy.
3. Accessible only through that specific object (instance level).
