"""
Functions:
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
It is defined using def and can exist independently â€” not tied to any object.

Methods:
A method is a function that belongs to an object (like a list, string, or class instance).
It always operates on that object, and you call it using dot notation.
